# Program to demonstrate how the print function works

print("Hello World!!!")       #Whatever you want to print must be enclosed within double quotes
print(10)         #We can also print numbers directly
print("Hello World" , 108)       #We can print multiple things separated by comma
print(12*3)       #We can perform any type of calculations(See output)
print("If you want to break line \n use backslash n")
print("To print double quotes (\") use backslash and to print backslash (\\) we use escape sequences")
"""These are called escape sequences which are printed on the output screen """

#This is a single line comment
"""Comments in triple double quotes are multiline comments"""
'''Comments in triple single quotes are also multiline comments'''
